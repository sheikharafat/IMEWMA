From line 1 to 11, we generate the W1 and W2 coefficient values. L coefficient value is taken from Table 1.
The variable “x1 to x15” the 15 subgroups each contains 5 samples which is taken from cancer patient survival time data set. “s1 to s15” are the estimates of the scale parameters for these 15 sub-groups. “sigma_bar” is the mean of the estimated scale parameter values. “z1 to z15” is the plotting statistic. The vector “ZIM” contains all the plotting statistic where we add 25% shift to the 9th to 15th samples. The upper control limit, center line and lower control limit are calculated in to line 71, 72 and 73 respectively
In line 77, we plot the plotting statistic.
