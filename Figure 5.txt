In line 1, “shift” indicated the different shift values.
In line 2, ”ARL_v” gives the ARL of V control chart. These values are taken from Table 9.
In line 3, “ARL_0.75” gives the ARL of IMEWMA control chart at lambda=0.75 and n=6. These values are taken from Table 6.
In line 4, “ARL_0.50” gives the ARL of IMEWMA control chart at lambda=0.50 and n=6. These values are taken from Table 7.
In line 5, “ARL_0.25” gives the ARL of IMEWMA control chart at lambda=0.25 and n=6. These values are taken from Table 8.
From lines 7 to 10, we plot these values respectively and finally got Figure 5.
