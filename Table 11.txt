In line 1, “del” indicated the different shift values.
In line 3, “arl_0.25” gives the ARL of IMEWMA control chart at lambda=0.25 and n=6. These values are taken from Table 8.
In line 4, “arl_0.50” gives the ARL of IMEWMA control chart at lambda=0.50 and n=6. These values are taken from Table 7.
In line 5, “arl_0.75” gives the ARL of IMEWMA control chart at lambda=0.75 and n=6. These values are taken from Table 6.
In line 6, ”arl_v” gives the ARL of V control chart. These values are taken from Table 9.

Now, according to the described procedure from “Performance Evaluation of the IMEWMA control chart” section of the main manuscript, we calculate the EQL, PCI and RARL.
In line 23, EQL_0.25 gives the extra quadratic loss value of the proposed IMEWMA control chart at lambda=0.25.
In line 24, EQL_0.50 gives the extra quadratic loss value of the proposed IMEWMA control chart at lambda=0.50.
In line 25, EQL_0.75 gives the extra quadratic loss value of the proposed IMEWMA control chart at lambda=0.75.
In line 26, EQL_V gives the extra quadratic loss value of the V control chart.

In line 29, PCI_0.25 gives the performance comparison index value of the proposed IMEWMA control chart at lambda=0.25.
In line 30, PCI_0.50 gives the performance comparison index value of the proposed IMEWMA control chart at lambda=0.50.
In line 31, PCI_0.75 gives the performance comparison index value of the proposed IMEWMA control chart at lambda=0.75.
In line 32, EQL_V gives the performance comparison index value of the V control chart.

In line 50, RARL_0.25 gives the relative average run length value of the proposed IMEWMA control chart at lambda=0.25.
In line 51, RARL_0.50 gives the relative average run length value of the proposed IMEWMA control chart at lambda=0.50.
In line 52, RARL_0.75 gives the relative average run length value of the proposed IMEWMA control chart at lambda=0.75.
In line 53, RARL_V gives the relative average run length value of the V control chart.
