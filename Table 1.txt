By using this program, we have constructed Table 1.
In line 1, “L” ,”n”,”ARL_0” and “del” indicate the coefficients values, sample size, in control ARL and amount of shift respectively.
In line 2, sge2 and lambda define the scale parameter (sigma) and smoothing contestant respectively.
In line 6, “r” is the inverse Maxwell random variable.
In line 7, “p” is the estimates of the scale parameter (sigma).
The variable “Z” is the plotting statistic.
In line 13 and 14, “lcl” and “ucl” indicated the lower control limit and upper control limit respectively.
Finally, in line 26, we get the average run lrngth (ARL).

First of all, for fixed sample size, shift and lambda, we assume a value for “L” and check the ARL whether it is approximately 370 or not. If it is not then we change the value and again assume a new value then check the ARL. When we get the expected ARL for the considered “L” value then we put that value into Table 1. By adopting this procedure, we have constructed Table 1.
