In line 1, the variable “x” contains the data values.
In line 2, the variable “t” indicates the truncation time.
In line 3, we read the size (“n1”) of our data set.
In line 4 to 13, we develop a loop that gives us values which are larger than the truncation time “t”. In to line 14, the variable “y” contains these values.
In line 15, we arrange the values in ascending order and defined them as a variable namely “r”.
In line 16, we read the size (“n”) of our data set after truncation.
In line 17 to 19, we estimate the scale parameter (“sigma”).
In line 20, we use a package named “zipfR” which provide us an incomplete gamma function that is necessary for developing the CDF of our studying distribution.
In line 21 and 22, “F1” and “F2” define the CDF of the after-truncation data values and the truncated values respectively.
Now according to Klugman et al. defined K-S test, we calculate the test statistic value “D”. In line 42, we get the maximum value of the test statistic which is the expected one.
Finally, we compare this value with the critical values. Into line 46 to 53, the critical values are given for 1%, 5% and 10% level of significance.
