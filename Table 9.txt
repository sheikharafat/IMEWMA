By using this program, we have constructed Table 9.
In line 1, “L1 and L2” ,”n”,”ARL_0” and “del” indicate the coefficients values, sample size, in control ARL and amount of shift respectively.
In line 2, sge2 and lambda define the scale parameter (sigma) and smoothing contestant respectively. “lcl” and “ucl” indicated the lower control limit and upper control limit respectively.
In line 6, “r” is the Maxwell random variable.
In line 7, “p” is the estimates of the scale parameter (sigma).
The variable “P” is the plotting statistic.
Finally, in line 23, we get the average run length (ARL) for in control situation.

Then we repeat lines 1 to 24 by by only increasing the amount of shift. In this program a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9 and a10 gives the ARL values for in control situation, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%,25%,35%, 50%, 75% and 100% variations respectively. Finally, the ARL vector contains them al together.
All the required values to construct this program are taken from Hossain et al.’s “New V control chart for Maxwell distribution” paper.
The remaining values of Table 9 are taken from Table 6 to 8.
